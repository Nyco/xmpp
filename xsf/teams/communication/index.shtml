<h2>XSF Communication Team</h2>

<p>The mission of the Communication Team is to continuously improve the editorial quality of written, spoken, and visual materials produced by the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).</p>
<p>The Team achieves its mission through several core activities, which include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Editorial reviews of specifications in the XSF's <a href='/extensions/'>XEP series</a></li>
  <li>Production of white papers, developer guides, HOWTOS, glossaries, slide presentations, tutorials, brochuers, and other information for use by those who develop, deploy, and use XMPP technologies</li>
  <li>Timely publication of informal reports about XMPP, such as postings at the XSF's <a href=/http://blog.xmpp.org/'>weblog</a></li>
  <li>Maintenance of the xmpp.org website, including content, navigation, and "look and feel"</li>
</ul>

<h2>XSF Technical Review Team</h2>

<p>The XSF's Technical Review Team is responsible for completing technical reviews of <a href='/extensions/'>XMPP Extension Protocols</a> (XEPs). Although the team's reviews are purely advisory and do not have any official weight within the XSF's standards process (e.g., as formal input to voting by the <a href='/council/'>XMPP Council</a>), such reviews help the XSF improve the <a href='/protocols/'>XMPP protocol stack</a>. The team can review specifications on its own initiative or when requested to do so by the <a href='/council/'>XMPP Council</a>, and at any stage in the XSF's <a hrf='/extensions/xep-0001.html'>standards process</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before a "ProtoXEP" is accepted for publication by the XMPP Council</li>
  <li>While a XEP is in the Experimental state</li>
  <li>During a Last Call related to advancement of a specification from Experimental to Draft (or Active)</li>
  <li>While a XEP is in the Draft state</li>
  <li>During a Call for Experience related to advancement of a specification from Draft to Final</li>
  <li>While a XEP is in the Final state</li>
</ul>
<p>Reviews generally follow the <a href='template.shtml'>template</a> and are sent to the <a href='http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards'>standards@xmpp.org</a> list.</p>
<p>The team members (and their areas of expertise) are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fabio Forno (mobile, pubsub, core)</li>
  <li>Nathan Fritz (pubsub)</li>
  <li>Waqas Hussain (MUC, pubsub, core)</li>

      <t>Technologies such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and IPsec enable a secure connection between two entities (a "client" and a "server") using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  This document specifies recommended procedures for checking the identity of the server in such an interaction.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>Technologies such as Transport Layer Security <xref target='TLS'/> and <xref target="IPsec"/> enable a secure connection between two entities using the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as described in <xref target="X509"/>.  In such interactions, the entity that initiates the connection is called a "client" and the entity that receives the connection is called a "server".</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: The terms "client" and "server" as used here refer to security roles, not application roles; a server in the context of TLS or IPSec might be a "client" (i.e., a user agent) in the context of an application protocol as deployed on the Internet.</t></list></t>
      <t>If a client wishes to connect to a server securely, it needs to check the identity of the server so that it can determine if the server is what it claims to be, verify that there is no attacker in the middle, etc.  Typically this is done by correlating the information presented in the server's certificate with information available about the server contained in the Domain Name System (DNS).</t>
      <t>Different application protocols that make use of the client-server pattern for security purposes have traditionally specified their own procedures for checking server identities.  Examples include but are not limited to:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol <xref target="HTTP"/>, for which see also <xref target="HTTP-TLS"/></t>
          <t>The Internet Message Access Protocol <xref target="IMAP"/> and Post Office Protocol <xref target="POP3"/>, for which see also <xref target="USINGTLS"/></t>
          <t>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol <xref target="LDAP"/>, for which see also <xref target="LDAP-AUTH"/> and its predecesor <xref target="LDAP-TLS"/></t>
          <t>The Session Initiation Protocol <xref target="SIP"/>, for which see also <xref target="SIP-CERTS"/></t>
          <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol <xref target="XMPP"/>, for which see also <xref target="XMPPBIS"/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Unfortunately, this divergence of approaches has caused some confusion among developers and protocol designers.  Therefore this document specifies recommended identity checking procedures for application protocols produced within the Internet Standards Process, for the purpose of codifying secure authentication practices.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conventions" anchor="conventions">
      <t>The following capitalized keywords are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="TERMS"/>: "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED"; "MUST NOT", "SHALL NOT"; "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED"; "SHOULD NOT", "NOT RECOMMENDED"; "MAY", "OPTIONAL".</t>
      <t>Most security-related terms are to be understood in the sense defined in <xref target="SECTERMS"/>; such terms include, but are not limited to, "assurance", "attack", "authentication", "authorization", "certificate", "certification authority", "confidentiality", "credential", "downgrade", "encryption", "fingerprint", "hash value", "identity", "integrity", "signature", "security perimeter", "self-signed certificate", "sign", "spoof", "tamper", "trust", "trust anchor", "trust chain", "validate", "verify".</t>
      <t>In addition, we define the following terms to assist in understanding the process of verifying identity:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="identity set:">The set of identities that are presented by the server to the client (in the form of the server's X.509 certificate) when the client is attempts to establish a secure connection to the server.</t>
          <t hangText="identity type:">The natural kind of identity to which a presented identity or reference identity belongs.  For example, the reference identity might be a domain name, an IPv4 or IPv6 address, an email address, a SIP address, a JabberID, or some other type (this specification does not provide a complete taxonomy of identity types).</t>
          <t hangText="presented identity:">A single member of the identity set.</t>
          <t hangText="reference identity:">The client's conception of the server's identity before it attempts to establish a secure connection to the server; this is the identity that the client expects the server to present and to which the client makes reference to when attempting to verify the server's identity.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Verification Process" anchor="verify">
      <t>When a client connects to a server, it MUST verify the server's identity (in order to prevent passive and active attacks against the connection).  By "verify identity" we mean that the client needs to establish that at least one of the identities in the identity set matches the reference identity.</t>
      <section title="Overview" anchor="verify-overview">
        <t>At a high level, the client verifies the server identity as follows:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>Before connecting to the server, the client determines the identity type of the reference identity.</t>
            <t>During the process of attempting to establish a secure connection, the server MUST present its identity set to the client in the form of an X.509 certificate <xref target="X509"/>.</t>
            <t>Upon being presented with the server's identity set, the client MUST check each presented identity against the reference identity for the purpose of finding a match.</t>
            <t>Before attempting to find a match in relation to a particular presented identity, the client MAY map the reference identity to a different identity type.  Such a mapping MAY be performed for any available subjectAltName type to which the reference identity can be mapped; however, the reference identity SHOULD be mapped only to types for which the mapping is either inherently secure (e.g., extracting the DNS name from a URI to compare with a subjectAltName of type dNSName) or for which the mapping is performed in a secure manner (e.g., using DNSSEC, or using user-configured or admin-configured host-to-address/address-to-host lookup tables).</t>
            <t>To find a match, the client iterates through all of the subjectAltName extensions it recognizes in the server's certificate (potentially in an application-specific preference order) and compares the value of each extension against the reference identity until it has either produced a match or exhausted the identities in the identity set (comparison rules for matching particular subjectAltName extensions are provided under <xref target="verify-rules"/>).  The client MAY also check the subjectName field as described under <xref target="verify-rules-cn"/>.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t><list style='empty'><t>Note: Beyond the server identity check described in this section, clients might complete further checking to ensure that the server is authorized to provide the service it is requested to provide.  The client might need to make use of local policy information in making this determination.</t></list></t>
      </section>
      <section title="Comparison Rules" anchor="verify-rules">
        <section title="Comparison of DNS Names" anchor="verify-rules-dnsname">
          <t>If the reference identity is an internationalized domain name, conforming implementations MUST convert it to the ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) format as specified in Section 4 of <xref target='IDNA'/> before comparison with subjectAltName values of type dNSName.  Specifically, conforming implementations MUST perform the conversion operation specified in Section 4 of RFC 3490 as follows:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>in step 1, the domain name SHALL be considered a "stored string";</t>
              <t>in step 3, set the flag called "UseSTD3ASCIIRules";</t>
              <t>in step 4, process each label with the "ToASCII" operation; and</t>
              <t>in step 5, change all label separators to U+002E (full stop).</t>
            </list>
          </t> 
          <t>After performing the "to-ASCII" conversion, the DNS labels and names MUST be compared for equality according to the rules specified in Section 3 of RFC3490.</t>
          <t>The '*' (ASCII 42) wildcard character is allowed in subjectAltName values of type dNSName, and then only as the left-most (least significant) DNS label in that value.  This wildcard matches any left-most DNS label in the server name.  That is, the subject *.example.com matches the server names a.example.com and b.example.com, but does not match example.com or a.b.example.com.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Comparison of IP Addresses" anchor="verify-rules-ipaddress">
          <t>When the reference identity is an IP address, the identity MUST be converted to the "network byte order" octet string representation (see <xref target='IP'/> and <xref target='IPv6'/>).  For IP Version 4, as specified in <xref target='IP'/>, the octet string will contain exactly four octets.  For IP Version 6, as specified in <xref target='IPv6'/>, the octet string will contain exactly sixteen octets.  This octet string is then compared against subjectAltName values of type iPAddress.  A match occurs if the reference identity octet string and value octet strings are identical.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Comparison of Common Name" anchor="verify-rules-cn">
          <t>In addition to checking the subjectAltName extensions, the client MAY check the Common Name (CN) <xref target='LDAP-SCHEMA'/> value in the leaf Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the subjectName field of the server's certificate.  This comparison is performed using the rules for comparison of DNS names in Section 3.1.3.1, below, with the exception that no wildcard matching is allowed.  Although the use of the Common Name value is existing practice, it is deprecated, and Certification Authorities are encouraged to provide subjectAltName values instead.  Note that the TLS implementation may represent DNs in certificates according to X.500 or other conventions.  For example, some X.500 implementations order the RDNs in a DN using a left-to-right (most significant to least significant) convention instead of LDAP's right-to-left convention.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Comparison of Other subjectName Types" anchor="verify-rules-other">
          <t>Client implementations MAY support matching against subjectAltName values of other types as described in other documents.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Outcome" anchor="verify-outcome">
        <t>The outcome of the checking procedure is one of the following:</t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='Case #1:'>The client finds at least one presented identity that matches the reference identity; the entity MUST use this as the validated identity of the server.</t>
            <t hangText='Case #2:'>The client finds no subjectAltName that matches the reference identity but a human user has permanently accepted the certificate during a previous connection attempt; the client MUST verify that the cached certificate was presented and MUST notify the user if the certificate has changed since the last time that a secure connection was successfully negotiated.</t>
            <t hangText='Case #3:'>The client finds no subjectAltName that matches the reference identity and a human user has not permanently accepted the certificate during a previous connection attempt; the client MUST NOT use the presented identity (if any) as the validated identity of the server and instead MUST proceed as described in the next section.  Instead, if the client is a user-oriented application, then it MUST either (1) automatically terminate the connection with a bad certificate error or (2) show the certificate (including the entire certificate chain) to the user and give the user the choice of terminating the connecting or accepting the certificate temporarily (i.e., for this connection attempt only) or permanently (i.e., for all future connection attempts) and then continuing with the connection; if a user permanently accepts a certificate in this way, the client MUST cache the certificate (or some non-forgeable representation such as a hash value) and in future connection attempts behave as in Case #2.  (It is the resposibility of the human user to verify the hash value or fingerprint of the certificate with the peer over a trusted communication layer.)  If the client is an automated application, then it SHOULD terminate the connection with a bad certificate error and log the error to an appropriate audit log; an automated application MAY provide a configuration setting that disables this check, but MUST provide a setting that enables the check.</t>

<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems.  It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers .  A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990.  This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .

<t>This Glossary provides definitions, abbreviations, and explanations of terminology for information system security.  The 334 pages of entries offer recommendations to improve the comprehensibility of written material that is generated in the Internet Standards Process (RFC 2026).  The recommendations follow the principles that such writing should (a) use the same term or definition whenever the same concept is mentioned; (b) use terms in their plainest, dictionary sense; (c) use terms that are already well-established in open publications; and (d) avoid terms that either favor a particular vendor or favor a particular technology or mechanism over other, competing techniques that already exist or could be developed.

<date month='August' day='14' year='2009' />
<abstract><t>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements for the purpose of exchanging structured information in close to real time between any two or more network-aware entities.  XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety of applications can be built.  The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions.  This document also specifies the format for XMPP addresses, which are fully internationalizable.  This document obsoletes RFC 3920.</t></abstract>
